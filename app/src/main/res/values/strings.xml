    <string name="home_how_to_desc">What the Blank is a game to be played with at least 4 people.
        To begin, everyone is split into equal sized teams and every person is given the same amount
        of pieces of paper (cards). The default amount per person is 3. On those cards, every person
        writes down a phrase, word, action, etc. in secret. They cannot let anyone else see what
        they write. Once they have them filled out, they would fold them and put them into a hat
        along with everyone else\'s cards. They would then be mixed up and the game can begin.
        \n\nNext, it is decided which team will begin. They will have an amount of time to figure
        out what the card says. By default, it is usually 30 seconds. \n\nThe game is in three
        rounds. The first round allows the person holding the card to say, act, and do anything they
        want to do to get their partners to guess the card correctly. They are just not allowed to
        say what is actually on the card. For example: if the card was \'cat\', they can say: \"it\'s
        raining this and dogs\" so that the teammates would realize the person was actually saying
        \"it\'s raining CATS and dogs\" and so they would guess cats and the card holder would go on
        to the next randomly picked card. They do this until the 30 seconds runs out. \n\nThen the
        cards that were guessed correctly are tallied up and counted as points. The remaining cards
        are still in the hat and the next team goes until their time runs out. Then the next team,
        and it keeps going until the cards run out.\n\nThe second round then begins. This round,
        the person holding the card can only act. They cannot make any noises at all.\n\nThe third
        round begins when all the cards have been correctly guessed by the teams. This round, the
        person holding the card can only say one word. They can\'t act out anything. They can\'t say
        any other words. \n\nOnce all cards are guessed correctly, the scores are tallied and the
        team with the most points wins.</string>
